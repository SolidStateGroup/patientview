                    <h4>Point 1 - Consultation</h4>
                    <p>When you arrive at Point 1 this will mean that you have had your initial consultation with a Living Donor
                        Coordinator at your hospital. During that consultation you will have been provided with further information
                        and then registered on Donor View. This will be the start of your journey through the Donor Pathway.</p>

                    <p>When you arrive at Point 2 this will mean that you are entering a period of testing. This testing will
                        cover such things as routine bloods, cross matching with the recipient, x-rays and ECCGs. These tests
                        will determine your suitability as a donor. Your test results will be displayed on the system when
                        available.

                    <p>When you arrive at Point 3 this will mean that your results are being reviewed by a clinician to assess
                        your suitability as a donor. When that decision has been made it will outline whether you are able
                        to move forward to the next point, whether you need further testing, whether you are on hold
                        for other reasons or if the decision is no to donating. The outcome of the review will also have
                        been conveyed to you outside of Donor View.</p>

                        the system when available. When those tests have been completed the system will inform you whether
                        further investigation is needed, whether you can move forward to planning your operation or if the
                        decision is no to donating. The outcome of the review will also have been conveyed to you outside
                        of Donor View.</p>

<p>PatientView provides secure access to your blood tests, clinic letters, medicines. You'll find tailored information
links, from accurate and reliable sources. PV2 (2015) introduced secure messaging.  We hope it will help you manage your
condition more effectively.</p>

<h3>Questions about your health</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about your condition, you should contact your own team.  It may be possible to do that
    through PatientView, but you will have contact details anyway.</p>

<h3>Questions about your own information</h3>
<p>If you are a patient, and suspect that wrong information is being shown, you need to contact the place that sends
    your info to PatientView. <a href="/#/contact">Click here to send a message to your unit</a>

<h3>Other questions</h3>
<p>For any queries about login problems, incorrect details on the site, content issues, results not appearing or being
    wrong, or any concerns or feedback, please read the FAQs below, but if they aren’t answered there please contact us.

<h3><a id="faq1"></a>How does it work?</h3>
<p>PatientView takes information from your hospital's and GP's computer system and links it to useful explanations about
    your condition and its treatment. It shows blood test results, clinic letters (if they are on your hospital's computer
    system), and much more. It is updated at least once a day so that it should be up to date. Because it mostly shows
    information from other computer systems, you should contact whoever sent the info  (your clinic or GP) if you see
    errors.</p>

<p>Technical information: Data is automatically sent to the PatientView server at least daily via a gateway PC. Downloads
    for a patient are activated by a flag in the local information system. This is triggered by a local administrator after
    receiving the patient's signed agreement. The PatientView server accumulates data prospectively. Very old results etc.
    are not transferred.</p>

<h3><a id="faq2"></a>Who can read it?</h3>
<p>Patients can, your GP can, and a limited number of staff from the clinical team can. Also, patients may share their
    password with anyone they want. So it can be used to show information to relatives, friends, and to healthcare staff
    in other locations where your notes are not available.</p>

<h3><a id="faq3"></a>Where did it come from?</h3>
<p>There is more info about PatientView and its history at <a href="http://www.rixg.org/patientview">rixg.org/patientview</a>.
See <a href="http://www.rixg.org/patientview/pages/about/history.php" target="_blank">History</a>, or
 <a href="http://www.rixg.org/patientview/pages/how-to/intro-to-rpv.php" target="_blank">Intro to PV</a> first.</p>

<h3><a id="faq4"></a>About the info links</h3>
<p>We have chosen websites that we think give good, reliable advice. Almost all of it is written by other people.
    Remember that the information is general advice - the authors of it do not know your personal circumstances, which
    may be different.  If you are having any specific problems please contact your GP or another healthcare professional
    to get help. We believe that the information provided from external websites contain useful and unbiased
    information. However mistakes can occur, we cannot be responsible for the accuracy of their content or the views of
    the authors. <a href="http://www.rixg.org/patientview/pages/admin/links-policy.php" target="_blank">Read more about
        our links policy</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="faq5"></a>What if I move?</h3>
<p>We hope that more centres will join so that you can stay connected.</p>

<h3><a id="faq6"></a>Who can see what?</h3>
<p>The information presented is the same for all users. So staff can read patient information, and patients can
    read medical information.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Patients see only their own results and other information.</li>
    <li>GPs have a unique login for each of their registered patients at present. So if they have multiple patients,
        they must login again to see another.</li>
    <li>Unit staff who have logins may see the records of any PatientView patient from their unit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Patients may share their logins with relatives, staff in clinics that they are referred to, staff at other surgeries
    or foreign hospitals - or anyone else they choose. They can change their password at any time to restrict access
    again.</p>

<h3><a id="faq7"></a>Is it safe? Security and confidentiality</h3>
<p>We believe the system should be very safe. It uses security systems like the ones used for credit cards on
    the Internet.</p>
<p>All information is encrypted during transmission. The web server is very secure. External review of the system's
    security is undertaken. A detailed log of who has accessed what information is kept.</p>
<p>To maximise your security online, you should always click the 'logout' button in the top right of the screen. Once
    you have done this, close your web browser by clicking the 'x' in the top right corner.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Patients</strong>: The major risk is of someone else finding out or guessing your username/password. If you think someone
        may have discovered your password, you can change it at any time. Your information only goes onto PatientView at
        your request, and you can have it all removed from the system if you want.</li>
    <li><strong>Staff</strong>: The major risk is of a username/password combination being guessed or discovered. You
        will be aware how sensitive some information could be, and it is essential that you keep your login details
        secret and safe. Staff logins must not be shared. The correct way to permit an external person to see a
        PatientView record is for the patient to share their username and password.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="faq8"></a>How can I change what is shown?</h3>
<p>The web server only shows information that is recorded in local computer systems. To change it, changes need to be
    made in the local records. When a change is made, it may not be updated on the PatientView for up to 24h although
    usually it is much shorter than this.</p>
<p>Where results or letters are updated after being initially created, the system automatically allows an overwrite by
    new information for up to 10 days. Later than that, manual intervention by a local administrator will be required.</p>

<h3><a id="faq9"></a>What if I want to remove my information from the system?</h3>
<p>That is fine. However as it may be impossible to recreate the valuable record that PatientView builds up over time,
    we may ask for formal signed consent before withdrawing patients from the system.</p>

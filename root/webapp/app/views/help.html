        <p>PatientView provides secure access to your blood tests, clinic letters, medicines. You'll find tailored information
        links, from accurate and reliable sources. PV2 (2015) introduced secure messaging.  We hope it will help you manage your
        condition more effectively.</p>

        <h3>Questions about your health</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about your condition, you should contact your own team.  It may be possible to do that
            through PatientView, but you will have contact details anyway.</p>

        <h3>Questions about your own information</h3>
        <p>If you are a patient, and suspect that wrong information is being shown, you need to contact the place that sends
            your info to PatientView. <a href="/#/contact">Click here to send a message to your unit</a></p>.

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth0"></a>I've forgotten my login / I'm locked out</h3>
        <p>If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it yourself if: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You know your username, AND</li>
            <li>Your current email address is registered in the system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click on Login, then on 'Forgotten your password?'. If you do not know your username and email address you can contact
            your local units administrator by clicking the 'Contact' button at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth10"></a>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>PatientView takes information from your hospital's and GP's computer system and links it to useful explanations about
            your condition and its treatment. It shows blood test results, clinic letters (if they are on your hospital's computer
            system), and much more. It is updated at least once a day so that it should be up to date. Because it mostly shows
            information from other computer systems, you should contact whoever sent the info  (your clinic or GP) if you see
            errors.</p>

        <p>Technical information: Data is automatically sent to the PatientView server at least daily via a gateway PC. Downloads
            for a patient are activated by a flag in the local information system. This is triggered by a local administrator after
            receiving the patient's signed agreement. The PatientView server accumulates data prospectively. Very old results etc.
            are not transferred.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth20"></a>Who can read it?</h3>
        <p>Patients can, your GP can, and a limited number of staff from the clinical team can. Also, patients may share their
            password with anyone they want. So it can be used to show information to relatives, friends, and to healthcare staff
            in other locations where your notes are not available.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth30"></a>Where did it come from?</h3>
        <p>There is more info about PatientView and its history at <a href="http://www.rixg.org/patientview">rixg.org/patientview</a>.
        See <a href="http://www.rixg.org/patientview/pages/about/history.php" target="_blank">History</a>, or

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth40"></a>About the info links</h3>
        <p>We have chosen websites that we think give good, reliable advice. Almost all of it is written by other people.
            Remember that the information is general advice - the authors of it do not know your personal circumstances, which
            may be different.  If you are having any specific problems please contact your GP or another healthcare professional
            to get help. We believe that the information provided from external websites contain useful and unbiased
            information. However mistakes can occur, we cannot be responsible for the accuracy of their content or the views of
            the authors. <a href="http://www.rixg.org/patientview/pages/admin/links-policy.php" target="_blank">Read more about
                our links policy</a>.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth50"></a>What if I move?</h3>
        <p>We hope that more centres will join so that you can stay connected.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth60"></a>Who can see what?</h3>
        <p>The information presented is the same for all users. So staff can read patient information, and patients can
            read medical information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patients see only their own results and other information.</li>
            <li>GPs have a unique login for each of their registered patients at present. So if they have multiple patients,
                they must login again to see another.</li>
            <li>Unit staff who have logins may see the records of any PatientView patient from their unit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Patients may share their logins with relatives, staff in clinics that they are referred to, staff at other surgeries
            or foreign hospitals - or anyone else they choose. They can change their password at any time to restrict access
            again.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth70"></a>Is it safe? Security and confidentiality</h3>
        <p>We believe the system should be very safe. It uses security systems like the ones used for credit cards on
            the Internet.</p>
        <p>All information is encrypted during transmission. The web server is very secure. External review of the system's
            security is undertaken. A detailed log of who has accessed what information is kept.</p>
        <p>To maximise your security online, you should always click the 'logout' button in the top right of the screen. Once
            you have done this, close your web browser by clicking the 'x' in the top right corner.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Patients</strong>: The major risk is of someone else finding out or guessing your username/password. If you think someone
                may have discovered your password, you can change it at any time. Your information only goes onto PatientView at
                your request, and you can have it all removed from the system if you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Staff</strong>: The major risk is of a username/password combination being guessed or discovered. You
                will be aware how sensitive some information could be, and it is essential that you keep your login details
                secret and safe. Staff logins must not be shared. The correct way to permit an external person to see a
                PatientView record is for the patient to share their username and password.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth80"></a>How can I change what is shown?</h3>
        <p>The web server only shows information that is recorded in local computer systems. To change it, changes need to be
            made in the local records. When a change is made, it may not be updated on the PatientView for up to 24h although
            usually it is much shorter than this.</p>
        <p>Where results or letters are updated after being initially created, the system automatically allows an overwrite by
            new information for up to 10 days. Later than that, manual intervention by a local administrator will be required.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqnoauth90"></a>What if I want to remove my information from the system?</h3>
        <p>That is fine. However as it may be impossible to recreate the valuable record that PatientView builds up over time,
            we may ask for formal signed consent before withdrawing patients from the system.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff10"></a>I've forgotten my login / I'm locked out</h3>
        <p>If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it yourself if: </p>

            <li>You know your username, AND</li>

        <p>Click on Login, then on 'Forgotten your password?'. If you do not know your username and email address you
            can contact your local units administrator by clicking the 'Contact' button at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff20"></a>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>PatientView takes information from your renal unit's computer system and links it to useful explanations
            about your kidney condition and its treatment. It shows blood test results, clinic letters (if they are on
            your unit's renal computer system), and much more. It is updated at least once a day so that it should be up
            to date. Because it shows information from your local unit's computer system, you should contact your local
            unit if you see (or suspect) errors. Technical information: Downloads for a patient are activated by a flag
            in the local information system. This is triggered by a local administrator after receiving your signed
            agreement. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff30"></a>Who can read it?</h3>
        <p>Patients can, a patient's GP can, and a limited number of staff from the renal unit can. Also, patients may
            share their password with anyone they want. So it can be used to show information to relatives, friends, and
            to healthcare staff in other locations where renal notes are not available. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff40"></a>Where has this come from?</h3>
        <p>PatientView was developed by  <a href="http://www.rixg.org/" target="_blank">RIXG</a>, the Renal Information
            EXchange Group. This is a group representing patients and renal teams which was formed in 2003 to make
            advances in IT work to help renal patients. The PatientView pilot project began in 2004, funded by the
            Department of Health, and the full project was officially launched in 2005. It is officially hosted now by
            the UK Renal Association (www.renal.org)</p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff50"></a>How do I join?</h3>
        <p>PatientView is only available at participating units, but that is now most units in the UK. To
            join, you sign the enrolment form after seeing examples or a demo. A member of staff signs the form too.
            It is then given to your local PatientView administrator. They will send starter information, and
            your username and password, to you and to your GP (your GP has a different login). You can also send your
            request to join by clicking on the 'I want to join' button at
            <a href="http://www.patientview.org" target="_blank">www.patientview.org</a>. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff60"></a>My unit isn't using PatientView. How can I get it to join?</h3>
        <p>We hope that soon almost all units will be participating. In some units, changes to their local computer
            systems have delayed joining. A few units, especially at children's hospitals, don't have computer-held
            records at all, and this has delayed them.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff70"></a>What if I don't use the Internet?</h3>
        <p>Maybe you have a friend or family member that does, and they could help you? Public libraries often have
            computers you could use. We are also working to make RPV available through phones and possibly via digital
            TVs. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff80"></a>What does it cost?</h3>
        <p>It is free to patients. There is a small annual cost to each unit to join the system.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff90"></a>What if I move?</h3>
        <p>If you move to a different unit, either permanently or temporarily (e.g. for a transplant), you can sign up
            in the new centre too, and your records will be combined. This can be very useful to staff in both centres,
            as well as to patients.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff100"></a>Who can see what?</h3>
        <p>The information presented is the same for all users. So staff can read patient information, and patients can
            read medical information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patients see only their own results and other information.</li>
            <li>GPs have a unique login for each of their registered patients at present. So if they have multiple patients,
                they must login again to see another.</li>
            <li>Unit staff who have logins may see the records of any PatientView patient from their unit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Patients may share their logins with relatives, staff in clinics that they are referred to, staff at other surgeries
            or foreign hospitals - or anyone else they choose. They can change their password at any time to restrict access
            again.</p>
        <p>Staff must not share their logins.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff120"></a>How can I change what is shown?</h3>
        <p>PatientView shows mostly information that is recorded in other computer systems. To change it, changes need
            to be made at the place it is coming from. When a change is made, it may not be updated on the PatientView
            server for up to 24h. Changes to any of the last 10 items under each heading should be corrected this way.
            Older information will require manual intervention by a local administrator. If you yourself have entered
            information that is incorrect, you should contact your local PatientView Admin. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqstaff130"></a>What if I want to remove my information from the system?</h3>
        <p>That is fine. However as it may be impossible to recreate the valuable record that PatientView builds up over
            time, we ask for a formal signed request before withdrawing patients from the system. If you are registered
            in more than one unit, you will need to withdraw from each unit. We are reviewing how we do this at present
            (2014), and may give more options soon.</p>

            <li>Your current email address is registered in the system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click on Login, then on 'Forgotten your password?'. If you do not know your username and email address you

        <h3><a id="faqpatient20"></a>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>PatientView takes information from your renal unit's computer system and links it to useful explanations
            about your kidney condition and its treatment. It shows blood test results, clinic letters (if they are
            on your unit's renal computer system), and much more. It is updated at least once a day so that it should
            be up to date. Because it shows information from your local unit's computer system, you should contact your
            local unit if you see (or suspect) errors. Technical information: Downloads for a patient are activated by
            a flag in the local information system. This is triggered by a local administrator after receiving your
            signed agreement. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient30"></a>Who can read it?</h3>
        <p>Patients can, a patient's GP can, and a limited number of staff from the renal unit can. Also, patients may
            share their password with anyone they want. So it can be used to show information to relatives, friends, and
            to healthcare staff in other locations where renal notes are not available. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient40"></a>Where has this come from?</h3>
        <p>PatientView was developed by  <a href="http://www.rixg.org/" target="_blank">RIXG</a>, the Renal Information
            EXchange Group. This is a group representing patients and renal teams which was formed in 2003 to make
            advances in IT work to help renal patients. The PatientView pilot project began in 2004, funded by the
            Department of Health, and the full project was officially launched in 2005. It is officially hosted now by
            the UK Renal Association (www.renal.org)</p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient50"></a>How do I join?</h3>
        <p>Renal PatientView is only available at participating renal units, but that is now most units in the UK. Check
            on this list if you don't know if yours has it, or is due to get it. To join, you sign the enrolment form
            after seeing examples or a demo. A member of staff signs the form too. It is then given to your local
            PatientView administrator. They will send starter information, and your username and password, to you and
            to your GP (your GP has a different login). You can also send your request to join by clicking on the 'I
            want to join' button at
            <a href="http://www.patientview.org" target="_blank">www.patientview.org</a>. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient60"></a>My unit isn't using PatientView. How can I get it to join?</h3>
        <p>We hope that soon almost all units will be participating. In some units, changes to their local computer
            systems have delayed joining. A few units, especially at children's hospitals, don't have computer-held
            records at all, and this has delayed them.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient70"></a>What if I don't use the Internet?</h3>
        <p>Maybe you have a friend or family member that does, and they could help you? Public libraries often have
            computers you could use. We are also working to make RPV available through phones and possibly via digital
            TVs. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient80"></a>What does it cost?</h3>
        <p>It is free to patients. There is a small annual cost to each unit to join the system.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient90"></a>What if I move?</h3>
        <p>If you move to a different unit, either permanently or temporarily (e.g. for a transplant), you can sign up
            in the new centre too, and your records will be combined. This can be very useful to staff in both centres,
            as well as to patients.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient100"></a>Who can see what?</h3>
        <p>The information presented is the same for all users. So staff can read patient information, and patients can
            read medical information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patients see only their own results and other information.</li>
            <li>GPs have a unique login for each of their registered patients at present. So if they have multiple patients,
                they must login again to see another.</li>
            <li>Unit staff who have logins may see the records of any PatientView patient from their unit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Patients may share their logins with relatives, staff in clinics that they are referred to, staff at other surgeries
            or foreign hospitals - or anyone else they choose. They can change their password at any time to restrict access
            again.</p>
        <p>Staff must not share their logins.</p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient110"></a>Is it safe? Security and confidentiality</h3>
        <p>We believe the system should be very safe. It uses security systems like the ones used for credit cards on
            the Internet.</p>
        <p>All information is encrypted during transmission. The web server is very secure. External review of the system's
            security is undertaken. A detailed log of who has accessed what information is kept.</p>
        <p>To maximise your security online, you should always click the 'logout' button in the top right of the screen. Once
            you have done this, close your web browser by clicking the 'x' in the top right corner.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Patients</strong>: The major risk is of someone else finding out or guessing your
                username/password. If you think someone may have discovered your password, you can change it at any
                time. Your information only goes onto PatientView at your request, and you can have it all removed from
                the system if you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Staff</strong>: The major risk is of a username/password combination being guessed or
                discovered. You will be aware how sensitive some information could be, and it is essential that you keep
                your login details secret and safe. Staff logins must not be shared. The correct way to permit an
                external person to see a PatientView record is for the patient to share their username and password.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient120"></a>How can I change what is shown?</h3>
        <p>PatientView shows mostly information that is recorded in other computer systems. To change it, changes need
            to be made at the place it is coming from. When a change is made, it may not be updated on the PatientView
            server for up to 24h. Changes to any of the last 10 items under each heading should be corrected this way.
            Older information will require manual intervention by a local administrator. If you yourself have entered
            information that is incorrect, you should contact your local PatientView Admin. </p>

        <h3><a id="faqpatient130"></a>What if I want to remove my information from the system?</h3>
        <p>That is fine. However as it may be impossible to recreate the valuable record that PatientView builds up over
            time, we ask for a formal signed request before withdrawing patients from the system. If you are registered
            in more than one unit, you will need to withdraw from each unit. We are reviewing how we do this at present
            (2014), and may give more options soon.</p>

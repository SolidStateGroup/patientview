                You may feel overwhelmed by your illness and all the information that you are given.<br/>
                You may feel that you donâ€™t have a role in managing your health and that your doctor or nurse will make the decisions about your care.<br/>
                You may be feeling very negative and down.<br/>
                You may not feel confident to share your opinion or view about what might be best for you.

                You may have an understanding of some basic facts about your condition but not about how you might begin to play a role in managing it.<br/>
                You may not have the skills in place to problem solve.

                You are beginning to understand facts and take on board information about your condition.<br/>
                You are beginning to change some behaviours relating to caring for yourself.<br/>
                You may not feel confident in doing this on your own.

            <td>
                You have gained the knowledge, new skills and confidence to change some of your behaviours but during periods of stress or change these may lapse.<br/>
                You prepare before attending an appointment with your GP or hospital team.<br/>
                You may feel confident to ask questions during an appointment that will help you make decisions that best suit you and your family.<br/>
                You may feel positive about your life.

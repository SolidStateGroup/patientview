<h1>Welcome to PatientView 2</h1><p>PatientView shows patients' latest test results plus information about their diagnosis and treatment. They can share this information with anyone they want, and view it from anywhere in the world. PatientView has developed from a project launched for patients of Renal Units, but has expanded to be able to show information for others too. It requires your local unit to have joined. (e.g. renal unit, diabetes unit, IBD unit)</p>
